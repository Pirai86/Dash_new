                For data generated from the Illumina sequencing platform GA II, the base quality score usually starts out high,
                then gradually degrades as the cycle increases, moving along the read. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The drop in base quality score can be attributed
                to a variety of factors, including phasing/prephasing, a decreased signal to noise ratio and template damage over many
                cycles of laser imaging. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Later sequencing platforms (HiSeq, MiSeq) produce base quality scores in which the first 10â€“15 cycles
                / positions are relatively lower compared to the middle section of the read. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Both these patterns are expected and is not
                considered a hindrance for further alignment and data analysis. 

                To date, no alignment issues have been reported because of
                the lower-quality bases at the beginning of the reads.
